          <p>
            VikeLabs is a team of UVic students who build apps that make the
            UVic student experience smoother. We're building a suite of free
            tools to help you succeed academically and extracurricularly.
            <br />
            We have two main goals, help students succeed at school and help
            students gain experience in the tech industry.

            <h2>PASSR</h2>
            <p>
              For our first project we're building passr, a suite of tools for
              academic success which includes a grade calculator, an academic
              goal tracker, and a success planner.
              <br />
              The goal of Passr is to help students achieve the grades they want
              by spending less time organizing and more time studying.
